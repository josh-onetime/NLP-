# Simple NLP Project

### Project: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

Objective: The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that can classify movie reviews as either positive or negative.

<i>Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Keras</i>

#### Steps:

<b>Data Collection</b>: Used the IMDB movie reviews dataset. This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews that are labeled as either positive or negative.

<b>Data Cleaning</b>: Clean the text data by removing unnecessary characters, converting all text to lowercase, and removing stop words.

<b>Data Exploration</b>: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of positive and negative reviews. You can also explore the most common words in positive and negative reviews.

<b>Feature Extraction</b>: Attempted techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings to convert the text data into numerical features that can be used by a machine learning model.

<b>Model Building</b>: Build a machine learning model to classify the reviews. Trialed first a simple model like Logistic Regression, and then try more complex models like SVM or Random Forest. Next steps: experiment with deep learning models like LSTM or GRU.

<b>Model Evaluation</b>: Evaluated performance of model using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

<b>Hyperparameter Tuning</b>: Tune the hyperparameters of your model to improve its performance. (not yet complete)

<b>Model Interpretation</b>: Try to understand why your model is making certain predictions. You can use techniques like SHAP or LIME for model interpretation.
